### Big Architecture Graphic

The Big Architecture Graphic is shortened as BAG. It shows the high level system design the community will be developing for. This will be our informing whiteboard for brainstorming on our different repos. The guiding principles are below; 

- **Detailed Involvement**: We know it is easy to sketch lines and boxes to what you think an architecture should be without getting involved about how the sub-parts work. It is encouraged to be technically involved in at least one repo to be better informed of dependencies. In a nutshell, be involved from the bottom up in architectural improvement.
- **Ordered Changes**: The Changelog will guide the improvement of the BAG. There will be many changes submitted per repo and for the architecture itself. Maintainers will manage these change sets and apply it to the BAG when it matters. Summary of the changes will be communicated in the Changelog document. The Changelog will inform edits to the BAG.
- **Whiteboard Behaving**: As much as the project is inviting as many contributors out there, we will not like to limit the appearance of the BAG to be very professional from a CAD drawing. We encourage anyone to express how they draw on a whiteboard if respectfully they are communicating something essential to the community. The community will be glad to follow your marker.
