### Big Architecture Graphic

The Big Architecture Graphic is shortened as BAG. It will show the high level system design for the project. This will be our informing whiteboard for brainstorming on system architecture. The guiding principles are below; 

- **Detailed Involvement**: Whiles it is easy to sketch smart digrams without getting interested in lower level engineering, we encourage any contributor here to be technically involved in at least one repo to be better of informed of some dependencies. In other words, be interested from the bottom up.
- **Ordered Changes**: The Changelog will also guide the improvement of the BAG. There will be many changes submitted to repos along the line and Maintainers or Core Contributors will manage these change sets and apply it to the BAG on a need basis. Summary of the changes will be communicated in the Changelog document.
- **Whiteboard Behaving**: As much as the project is inviting a diverse number of contributors, we will not like to limit the look of the design to be very formal or professionally developed from a high end CAD. We encourage anyone to express how they draw on a digital whiteboard. The community will be glad to follow your marker.
